            My name is pronounced "HAY-a muh-JEED". I'm a University of
            Washington graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in Applied Computing and
            Minor in Education. When I'm not practicing solving coding problems
            on LeetCode you can bet I'm somewhere golfing while listening to a
            security and/or tech podcast. I'm fluent in English and proficient
            in Arabic (working on becoming fluent). My passions include
            cybersecurity and secure software development, that is ever-growing
            as we drive towards a stronger Internet of Things society.
