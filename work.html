                An average American worker wastes about 8 days per year by not
                using keyboard shortcuts. <br />Short-Keys is a program designed
                to teach users keyboard shortcuts and when to use them.
                <br />The game consists of 3 components: practice mode, test
                mode, and an encyclopedia of shortcuts. <br />Practice mode
                displays a shortcut on the screen and waits for user to type in
                the shortcut. Test Mode gives the user a set of tasks to
                complete using only shortcuts in a real-desktop environment. The
                encyclopedia maps the keyboard keys for all shortcuts tested in
                the program and a description for its use.

                One large problem our society faces is the ever-growing need for
                security in the current realm of the Internet of Things (IoT).
                Current predictions of the number of connected IoT devices are
                projected to hit 29 Billion by 2022. This rapid continuous
                growth of connected devices makes it increasingly infeasible to
                expect to send all of the data-to-be-processed to the cloud and
                then wait for it to be sent back after processing. Current IoT
                devices require almost real-time communication so it's important
                to move towards ways of faster-processing and lower latency in
                IoT. The projected rise of IoT connected devices also means
                there will be an exponential increase of volume and velocity of
                data, thus quick responses from processing centers are a major
                requirement for future IoT systems. <br /><br />Edge computing
                is one possible solution to the requirement of storage and
                processing needs as well as increased security of the
                transferred data. Edge computing does not come without its
                challenges and needs extensive research on how to secure the
                vast number of connected devices from attack. Because so many
                more devices will be connected and sharing data, there is a
                greater risk of data being stolen or compromised from insecure
                IoT devices. Edge computing can be a viable solution if the
                challenges of physical security, task offloading, and protection
                of data and encryption are addressed in the requirement stage of
                IoT development. <br /><br />This project is an implementation
                of an edge-of-things system, where computational tasks are
                securely offloaded to a local gateway connected to the network.
                <br />This implementation is based on research done in the paper
                "Deployment of Smart Home Management System at the Edge:
                Mechanisms and Protocols" by Jordi Mongay Batalla and Franciszek
                Gonciarz. <br /><br />The project consists of 2 main components:
                a local gateway connected to a local network or Home Area
                Network, which is based on a raspberry pi running Raspian OS,
                and a management system working in the cloud on Microsoft Azure
                App Services.
